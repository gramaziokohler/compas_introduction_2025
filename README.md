## Exercise

Write a brick wall in Python! 

* 2D grid of bricks (stretcher bond)
* **Inputs:** brick dimensions (x, y, z), row and column count
* **Output:** list of bricks (COMPAS boxes)
* Add a Draw component to visualize
* Bonus 1: Attractor point to control each brickâ€™s rotation
* Bonus 2: Half-bricks to have flushed ends

Use the following file as a starting point: [`/exercise/brick_wall.gh`](./exercise/brick_wall.gh).
